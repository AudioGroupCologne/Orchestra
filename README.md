# Orchestra - toolbox for Live Music Performances in the Metaverse 

Orchestra is an open-source for live music performances in metaverse environments. 
Orchestra includes components for live performances in A-Frame/NAF-based metaverse environments, with real-time streaming of volumetric video and audio (`aframe-kinectron`, `networked-resonance-audio`) , live coding (`aframe-bytebeat`, `aframe-stackbeat`, `aframe-jibniz`) and the integration
of [PureData](https://github.com/pure-data/) (`PdXR`) for performances with virtual instruments and interactive algorithms.    

## Dependencies

Orchestra is made for [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe)

Run this in a Networked-Aframe instance: [Networked-Aframe](https://github.com/networked-aframe/networked-aframe)
